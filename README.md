# From Label Error Detection to Correction: A Modular Framework and Benchmark for Object Detection Datasets

This repository contains validated pedestrian annotations for a subset of the KITTI object detection benchmark as well as the code for reproducing the results of the paper. The codebase assumes that the label error detection methods have been applied and the resulting scores are present for the predictions of the object detectors Cascade R-CNN and YOLOX. To do so, train the object detectors on the KITTI dataset as described in our publication and apply the label error detection methods as described in the corresponding publications.
